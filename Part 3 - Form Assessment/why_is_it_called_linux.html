        <p>
            Linux is called "Linux" because it was originally named after its creator, Linus Torvalds. When Linus developed the first version of the operating system kernel in 1991, he initially named it "Freax," a combination of "free," "freak," and "Unix." However, the name was changed to "Linux" when it was uploaded to a public server for wider distribution.
            <br>
            <br>
            The administrator of that server, Ari Lemmke, thought "Freax" was not a suitable name and decided to call it "Linux" instead, combining Linus's name with "Unix." The name stuck, and it has been called Linux ever since.
            <br>
            <br>
            There's no popular or official reference to Linux being called "linx," so if you saw it referred to as that, it might be a typo or an informal shorthand, but the correct name is "Linux."</p>
        <ol>
            <li class="custom_li"><b>Linus Torvalds' Initial Project:</b> Linus Torvalds, a Finnish student at the University of Helsinki, started working on what would become the Linux kernel in 1991. He aimed to create a free, open-source alternative to the MINIX operating system, which was a simplified Unix-like system used for educational purposes.</li>
            <li class="custom_li"><b>The Original Name "Freax":</b> Initially, Linus considered calling his project "Freax," combining "free," "freak," and "Unix." He wanted a name that reflected the open-source nature of the project and its Unix-like characteristics.</li>
            <li class="custom_li"><b>Change to "Linux":</b> When Linus wanted to share the code, he needed a place to upload it. He contacted Ari Lemmke, who managed FTP servers at the Finnish University Network (FUNET). Ari thought "Freax" was not a fitting name and chose "Linux" instead, combining Linusâ€™s first name with "Unix." Linus was initially hesitant about naming the project after himself but accepted it when the name stuck.</li>
            <li class="custom_li"><b>Release and Adoption:</b> The Linux kernel was first released on September 17, 1991, and quickly gained popularity among developers and enthusiasts. It was designed to be compatible with the GNU operating system tools and libraries, which led to the combination of Linux and GNU utilities in what we commonly use today as a Linux distribution.</li>
            <li class="custom_li"><b>Trademark and Recognition:</b> Linus later trademarked the name "Linux," and it became widely recognized as the operating system that is an open-source, Unix-like platform used globally in various computing environments, from personal computers to servers, mobile devices, and embedded systems.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>There are no common or historical references to Linux being called "linx," so it's likely a typo or a misunderstanding if you encountered it somewhere. The correct and official name has always been "Linux."</p>
